  <title>Annotation Scene Library overview</title>

<!-- Everything between <body> and </body> ends up in file overview-summary.html in the Javadoc. -->

<body>
The Annotation Scene Library provides classes to represent the annotations on a
Java program and read and write those annotations in various formats.

<h2>Structure</h2>

<ul>
<li>An {@link annotations.el.AScene} holds annotations for a set of classes
and packages.
</li>
<li>A {@link annotations.el.AElement} represents one particular element of a
Java program within an <code>AScene</code>.
</li>
<li>Package {@link annotations.io} provides routines to read and write
{@link annotations.el.AScene}s in various formats.
</li>
<li>An {@link annotations.Annotation} represents an annotation (which might be a
field of another annotation).  It can be attached to an {@link annotations.el.AElement}.
</li>
<li>An {@link annotations.AnnotationDef} represents an annotation definition,
consisting of a definition name and field names and types
({@link annotations.field.AnnotationFieldType}s).  It also indicates the
annotation's retention policy.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>
The example program <tt>annotations.tests.Example</tt> demonstrates the
library's annotation-processing capabilities.  Its source code (and also
example input and output) are distributed with the Scene Library.
