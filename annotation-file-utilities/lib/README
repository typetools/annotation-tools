Notice a long dependency chain for the Checker Framework qualifiers.
File
  annotation-tools/annotation-file-utilities/annotation-file-utilities.jar
includes the files from
  annotation-tools/annotation-file-utilities/lib/
in particular, the plume.jar there.
That plume.jar includes the Checker Framework qualifiers, because
the file
  plume-lib/java/plume.jar
includes the files in
  plume-lib/java/lib/
in particular, the checkers-quals.jar there.

Therefore, first build the Checker Framework, then put
checkers-quals.jar into plume-lib/java/lib and rebuild plume-lib.
Finally, rebuild annotation-tools.

Also note the lovely dependency: the Checker Framework build needs the
annotation-tools to build the annotated JDK.
Therefore, when adding the new NonNull Checker, which is used in
the annotated JDK, a temporary step using "ant bindist-nojdk" was
required.

Remember to rebuild all projects with JDK 6 to allow more general
use.

TODO: how can we make this dependency between projects easier to
manage and update?
